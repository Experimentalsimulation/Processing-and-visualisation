Plot wishlist:

Balance:


- Cm - alpha
- De - Cm
- De - Cl
- De - Cd

- Find trimmed conditions for all RPS settings

- Cl-alpha in trimmed
- Cl - Cd in trimmed


Secondary goals:

- Cm - RPS


Noise:

Check wind tunnel noise data with no model, and noise mic, see if these can help to get better data
~substract noise level wind on - winf off

Overall noise levels vs RPS
Overall noise level vs attitude + De

Spectral density analysis at TBD case

Difference between noise at nose vs back of fuselage
